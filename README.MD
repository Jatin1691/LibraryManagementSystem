Vite + Spring Boot Project
This repository contains a full-stack application with a Vite front-end and Spring Boot back-end.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (for Vite)
Java (for Spring Boot)
Maven (for Spring Boot)
MySQL or another database (if required)
Frontend (Vite)
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name/frontend
Install dependencies

Navigate to the front-end directory and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server

After the installation is complete, start the Vite development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The front-end should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or another port specified in the terminal).

Backend (Spring Boot)
Clone the repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, do so:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name/backend
Set up application properties

In the src/main/resources/application.properties (or application.yml), configure your database and any other necessary settings:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database-name
spring.datasource.username=your-database-username
spring.datasource.password=your-database-password
Build and run the application

Build and run the Spring Boot application with Maven:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
The back-end should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

Connecting Frontend and Backend
API Calls: Ensure that your front-end is making API calls to http://localhost:8080 or the appropriate back-end endpoint in your project.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Make sure that you have configured CORS in your Spring Boot application if the front-end and back-end are running on different ports.
Testing
Unit Tests: For testing Spring Boot, you can run:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw test
End-to-End Tests: You can write or use existing end-to-end tests for both the front-end and back-end.

Additional Setup
Environment Variables: If your project needs specific environment variables (like for connecting to databases or services), make sure to define them in your environment or application.properties file.

Building for Production:

For Vite:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
For Spring Boot:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean install
